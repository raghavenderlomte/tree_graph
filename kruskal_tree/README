This program implements the kruskal's algorythm which is used to get the minimun spanning tree of a given tree.
here we are storing the nodes in an array,i'm considering the indexes of those as nodes and by using the function "index_link(int,int)".
We send the source and destination nodes to form an edge.

"display(int,int)" function is used to display all the avaiable nodes.

"minimal_spanning()" performs the kruskals algorythm.
to get the executable run the make command
