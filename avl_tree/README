This program implements the algorythm of avl which is a self balancing tree.

This program performs the insertion and display operation.
when ever we insert node into tree we check its left and right sub tree heights if it is less than or equal to 1 then tree is balanced or else we have to balance it by using rotation operations.

To get the executable execute the make command.
